Two Stacks Queue
================

Implement a queue using two stacks. Queues are first in first out (FIFO) and stacks are last in first out (LIFO) abstract data types. They can be implemented in a vareity of ways, each having different best, average, and worst case complexities.

In this case, we achieve amortized constant time for enqueue and dequeue operations.
